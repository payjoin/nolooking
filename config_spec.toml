Lightning Optimizing Opening Server 

This server optimizes your channel opening from a remote wallet which supports PayJoin. It enables you to open one or more channels in a single transaction from remote LND with empty wallet using sats in PayJoin-compliant wallet. This way you save one chain transaction when opening from e.g. Wasabi, Blue Wallet, BTCPayServer, or other PayJoin-supporting wallet. It's basically a user-friendly way to do PSBT funding flow.
